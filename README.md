Project 2: Movies A(ubrey) to Z(ach) Created by Zach Bines and Aubrey Kazdan

Our Project 2 is titled: "Movies A(ubrey) to Z(ach) and is based around the central premise of comparing movies based on IMDb user-ratings scores.
Using the restful OMDb API, our website is able to dynamically generate elements based on movie titles, posters, years of release and plot synopses.

When the user reads the instructions and begins the game, the website generates a random movie based off a curated-list made by us.
The user is then prompted to find and input a movie that is ranked better than the curated movie.
When the user's movie choice is confirmed, two scores will append to the posters and will reveal which movie scored higher.

The website is able to iterate through our curated list in a replayable format so that the user can compare movies as many times as they please.

side note: In the js, we had to use .innerHTML = '' to ensure that containers cleared before they were repopulated AS WELL as replaceChildren(). We were getting errors on some devices and this seemed to fix it.
